Batch Correction Wehrens by Nenad Torbica
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Package containing an algorithm to perform batch correction on LC-MS Data with a 8-step procedure.
Corrections implemented by R.Wehrens, pipeline built by Nenad Torbica.
Example data is coming soon.
